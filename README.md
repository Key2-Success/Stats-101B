## Stats 101B
Stats 101B is Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiment, which I took under Professor Linda Zanontian in Winter of 2017. I have included 5 homework assignments and the final group project. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in R. My grades for the homework assignments and final group project are as follows:
